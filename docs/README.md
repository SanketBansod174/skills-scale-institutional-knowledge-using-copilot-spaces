# OctoAcme Project Management Docs Index ✅

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This index provides a concise overview of our project management approach and direct links to individual process documents in this folder.

## Project Management Processes Summary 💡
OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach focused on delivering customer value, reducing risk, and continuously improving our ways of working. Key principles include:

- **Customer-first & data-driven decisions** — prioritize work based on user value and measurable outcomes.
- **Clear initiation & alignment** — define scope, stakeholders, objectives, and success metrics early.
- **Incremental planning & execution** — use backlogs, iterations/sprints (as appropriate), and regular checkpoints to deliver value often.
- **Transparent risk management & communication** — identify risks early and communicate status openly with stakeholders.
- **Quality assurance across the lifecycle** — incorporate testing, reviews, and acceptance criteria into each phase.
- **Retrospective-driven improvement** — regularly capture lessons learned and act on them.
